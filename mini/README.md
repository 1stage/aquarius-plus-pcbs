# Aquarius<sup>+</sup> Mini
A reduced-cost, small form factor version of the **Aqaurius<sup>+</sup>**, designed as an entry point for 8-bit enthusiasts who want physical hardware.

## Introduction
The **Aqaurius<sup>+</sup> Mini** retains all of the components relevant to enjoying the platform, but removes legacy hardware components that are more specific to collectors of original **Aqaurius Computer** such as the cartridge and cassette ports.

## Platform Comparison
